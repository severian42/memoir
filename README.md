Building bridges through stories: A personal project born from hope



Sometimes the most meaningful projects come from the most personal places. I recently built "The Living Memoir" - a web app designed to help people share their life stories through guided biographical interviews.

Why I built this: I've always struggled to connect deeply with my biological father. Despite years of trying, we've never quite found a way to truly understand each other's perspectives and experiences. I realized that maybe what we needed wasn't just conversation, but a structured way to share our stories - the kind of deep, biographical storytelling that helps people really know each other.



What it does: The app guides users through 200+ carefully crafted questions spanning different life stages - from ancestry and childhood through later years. Based on proven research and interview techniques, it helps people document their memories, experiences, and perspectives in a meaningful way. Users can record audio responses (with live transcription), add photos, and compile everything into a beautiful PDF memoir.



Privacy & Security (because this matters):



- 100% serverless - everything stays in your browser

- No AI, LLMs, or external services processing your personal stories

- Robust local database with automatic backups

- Export/import your data anytime

- No accounts, no tracking, no data collection



I'm sharing this because I know I'm not alone in wanting deeper connections with family members. Whether it's bridging generational gaps, healing relationships, or simply preserving family history, sometimes we need the right tools to help us open up.



The app is free and open to anyone who might find it useful. If you've ever wished for a way to really understand someone's life story - or share your own - maybe this can help.
